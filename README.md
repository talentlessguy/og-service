## Usage

```go
package main

import (
	"log"
	"net/http"

	preview "github.com/talentlessguy/og-service"
)

func main() {

  origins := []string{"*"}

	s := preview.NewReactLinkPreviewService(origins)

	log.Println("Started a service on http://localhost:8080")

	log.Fatal(http.ListenAndServe(":8080", s))
}
```
